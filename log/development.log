<p>Now that you have properly configured Ruby and Rails on your machine, we have a few challenge questions listed below in this task list.
<strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong> for completion are listed below.</p>

<ol>
<li>Complete as many as you can/want to complete, but you <strong>must AT LEAST complete 1 from each task class</strong> (<code>[A]</code>, <code>[B]</code>, <code>[C]</code>, <code>[D]</code>, and <code>[E]</code>). We encourage you to complete as many as you can.</li>
<li>Clearly mark all modified code with comments indicating the task by title (e.g., <code>### Add archive support</code>).</li>
<li>Try to complete every challenge question in a single commit and use the task title as the commit message (e.g., <code>Add complete support</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can&#39;t get something working, add a comment to the README file or in the source describing what you were trying to do and why you think its not working.
There is no reason to spend an exorbitant amount of time on any one of these questions. They should be fairly straight-forward. Tasks like these will be frequent.</p>

<p>I recommend doing &#39;Add archive support&#39; first then archiving tasks you don&#39;t want to do. Just make sure you get one from each task class!</p>

<p><strong>Good Luck!</strong></p>

<p>Now that you have properly configured Ruby and Rails on your machine, we have a few challenge questions listed below in this task list.
<strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong> for completion are listed below.</p>

<ol>
<li>Complete as many as you can/want to complete, but you <strong>must AT LEAST complete 1 from each task class</strong> (<code>[A]</code>, <code>[B]</code>, <code>[C]</code>, <code>[D]</code>, and <code>[E]</code>). We encourage you to complete as many as you can.</li>
<li>Clearly mark all modified code with comments indicating the task by title (e.g., <code>### Add archive support</code>).</li>
<li>Try to complete every challenge question in a single commit and use the task title as the commit message (e.g., <code>Add complete support</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can&#39;t get something working, add a comment to the README file or in the source describing what you were trying to do and why you think its not working.
There is no reason to spend an exorbitant amount of time on any one of these questions. They should be fairly straight-forward. Tasks like these will be frequent.</p>

<p>I recommend doing &#39;Add archive support&#39; first then archiving tasks you don&#39;t want to do. Just make sure you get one from each task class!</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t get something working, add a comment to the README file or in the source describing what you were trying to do and why you think its not working.
There is no reason to spend an exorbitant amount of time on any one of these questions. They should be fairly straight-forward. Tasks like these will be frequent.</p>

<p>I recommend doing &#39;Add archive support&#39; first then archiving tasks you don&#39;t want to do. Just make sure you get one from each task class!</p>

<p><strong>Good Luck!</strong></p>
